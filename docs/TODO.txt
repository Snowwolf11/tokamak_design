1. Fix create_placeholder option in 00 (the current placeholders it creates are outdated)
2. Just filling in for NaNs in equilibrium.make_equilibrium() is scetchy
3. set max_eval in config files
4. Currently B0 and R0_B0_ref in optimization -> unnecessary 
5. Include greenwald limits, temperature, density, ...
6. Include logger in 09
7. Make option to choose that either all profiles (p,T,n) are independent ore choose which one is the dependent one
8. There are currently two EquilibriumResult class definitions (in stage01_fixed.py and equilibrium.py) - this is double.
9. The metrics are currently computed kinda independently of equilibrium_optimization.yaml (e.g. theenable: true/false doesnt really do miuch). So instead of using hardcoded schema lists (metrics._all_required_nan() and stage01_outputs._write_required_trace_metrics()), use the config file.
